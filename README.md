  # Note Taker 

  ## Description
  This repository contains code that builds a simple note taker application. Upon loading the webpage, the user hits the landing page, where they are encouraged to take notes with Express! Once the user clicks the button, they are taken to the "/notes" route, where the sample notes from the database are displayed along with any other notes that user has added themselves. The user can either click a note to display that note's content, or they can create a new note, inputting a title and the content of the note. If a user does not like what they have jotted down, they can clear the form for a fresh start, or they can create their note, which is saved to the database and displayed in the notes list on the left-hand side.
